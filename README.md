# Food-ordering-wesite
The Food Ordering Website is a personal project I created to simulate a basic online food delivery system. The platform allows users to browse and order both vegetarian and non-vegetarian foods easily from a simple and clean interface.

The goal of this project was to practice core web development skills like designing user-friendly pages, handling user interactions, and building a basic flow from browsing to ordering.

Key features include:

A categorized menu with veg and non-veg items

Add-to-cart and order functionality

Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and optionally Node.js for backend handling. It helped me understand the workflow of an online ordering system from both a user and developer perspective.

Purpose of the Project:
To practice and apply front-end and back-end web development skills

To understand the workflow of online food ordering systems

To build a real-world style project showcasing full-stack capabilities

To prepare for deployment and portfolio presentation

Key Features:
Menu Display: A categorized food menu showing vegetarian and non-vegetarian items with names, prices, and images

Add to Cart: Users can select food items and add them to a cart

Cart Summary: Shows selected items with quantity and total price

Order Placement: Users can confirm and place their order

Responsive Design: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens

Simple Navigation: Easy-to-use interface with clear user flow

(Optional) Backend Integration: Basic backend setup to handle orders (if you used Node.js or another backend)
